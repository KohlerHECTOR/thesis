Contributing to Hector's Thesis
============================

There are many ways to contribute to Hector's thesis. Improving the
writing is no less important than adding new results. If you find a typo, or have
made improvements, do not hesitate to create a GitHub issue or preferably submit
a GitHub pull request.

There are many other ways to help. In particular [improving, triaging, and
investigating issues](https://github.com/KohlerHECTOR/thesis/issues),
and [reviewing other developers' pull
requests](https://github.com/KohlerHECTOR/thesis/pulls)
are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project
maintainers.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps
us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,
link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
