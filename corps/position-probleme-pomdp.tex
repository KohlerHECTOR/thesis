\chapter{Introduction}\label{sec:intro-pomdp}
In the first part of the manuscript, we show that direct reinforcement learning of decision tree policies for MDPs, i.e. learning a decision tree that optimizes (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) is often very difficult.
In particular, we provide some insights as to why it is so difficult and show that indirect imitation of a neural network policy (Sec. \ref{sec:imit}), while not optimizing (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) directly, often yields very good tree policies in practice.

This first part of the manuscript is organised as follows.
In this Chapter we present, Topin et. al. \cite{topin2021iterative} framework for direct reinforcement learning of decision tree policies.
In Chapter \ref{sec:topin}, we reproduce experiments from Topin et. al. where we compare direct deep reinforcement learning (Sec. \ref{sec:drl}) of decision tree policies to indirect imitation of a neural network policy with a decision tree for the simple CartPole MDP.
In Chapter \ref{sec:pomdp}, we show that the direct approach proposed by Topin et. al. is equivalent to learning a deterministic memoryless policy for partially observable MDP (POMDP)\cite{POMDP,chap2} and show that this might be the biggest source of hardness.
In Chapter \ref{sec:pomdp-classif}, we further support this claim by constructing special instances of Topin et. al. in which the POMDPs are virtually fully observable, and show that in those cases, direct reinforcement learning of decision tree works well.  

\section{Learning Decision Tree policies for MDPs}
In the introductory example~\ref{sec:limits-il}, we have shown that imitation learning that optimizes the objective (\ref{def:il}) rather than the RL objective~\ref{def:mdp-obj}, are, unsuprisingly, prone tosub-optimality w.r.t the lattter objective.
This motivates the study and development of \textit{direct} decision tree learning algorithms.
There already exist such algorithms that return decision tree policies optimizing the RL objective for a given MDP.
Those algorithms either learn parametric trees or non-parametric trees.

Parametric trees are not ``grown'' from the root by iteratively adding internal or leaf nodes (c.f. Fig. \ref{fig:dt}), but are rather ``optimized'': the depth, internal nodes arrengement, and state-features to consider in each nodes are fixed \textit{a priori} and only the thresholds of each nodes are learned similar to doing gradient descent on neural network weights.
As the reader might have guessed, those parametric trees are advantageous in that they can be learned with the policy gradient \cite{pg_sutton}. Both \cite{silva}, \cite{vos2024optimizinginterpretabledecisiontree} and \cite{sympol} use PPO \cite{ppo} to optimize such differentiable decision trees. In particular, \cite{sympol} explicitely studies the gap in performances between their direct optimization and the indirect imitation.
While those methods optimize the RL objective (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) directly and train high-performing policies w.r.t the downstream tasks, in general a user cannot know \textit{a priori}  what a ``good'' tree policy structure should be for a particular MDP: either the specified structure is too deep and pruning will be required after training or the tree structure is not expressive enough to encode a good policy, i.e. parametric trees cannot trade off interpretability and performances during training.
Furthermore, authors from \cite{sympol} show that extra stabilizing tricks, such as adaptive batch sizes, are required during training to outperform indirect imitation in terms of RL objective (\ref{def:mdp-obj}).

Non-parametric trees are the standard model in supervised learning \cite{breiman1984classification,ID3,c45} and offer good trade-off between interpretability and performances when optimizing (\ref{def:sl}).
On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there exists onlye one work studying non-parametric trees to optimize a trade-off between interpretability and the RL objective (\ref{def:mdp-obj}): Topin et. al. \cite{topin2021iterative}.

Given an MDP for which one wants to learn a decision tree policy, Topin et. al. introduced iterative bouding Markov decision processes (IBMDPs) that are an augmented version of this base MDP with more state features, more actions, additional rewards that trade-off between the RL objective and number of added nodes, and additional transitions.
Authors showed that using RL to learn certain policies in IBMDPs is equivalent to growing a tree that optimizes a trade-off between interpretability and the RL objective (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) w.r.t the MDP of interest.

There also exists more specialized approaches that can return decision tree policies only for small problem classes.
In \cite{dt-maze}, authors prove that for maze-like MDPs, there always exist an optimal decision tree policy w.r.t \ref{def:mdp-obj} and provide an algorithm to find it. 
Finally, in \cite{dt-opt-mdp}, authors study decision tree policies for planning in MDPs, i.e., when the transitions and rewards are known.
In the next section we present IBMDPs as introduced in Topin et. al.\cite{topin2021iterative}.

\section{Iterative Bounding Markov Decision Processes}\label{sec:ibmdp}

The key thing to know about IBMDPs is that they are, as their name suggests, MDPs.
Hence, IBMDPs admits an optimal deterministic Markovian policy for problem (\ref{def:mdp-obj}).
In this part we will assume that all the MDP we consider are factored MDPs \ref{def:fmdp} with a finite set of actions, so we use bold fonts for states and observations as they are vector-valued.
However all our results generalize to discrete states (in $\mathbb{Z}^m$) MDP that we can factor using one-hot encodings. 
Given an MDP for which we want to learn a decision tree policy, that we call the base MDP, the states in an associated IBMDP are concatenations of the base MDP states and some observations. 
Those observations are information about the base states that are refined--``iteratively bounded''-- at each step and represent a subspace of the base MDP state space.
Actions available in an IBMDP are the actions of the base MDP, that change the state of the latter, and \textit{information gathering} actions that change the observation part of the IBMDP state.
Now, taking base actions in an IBMDP is rewarded like in the base MDP, this ensures that the base objective, e.g. balancing the pole or treating cancer, is still encoded in the IBMDP reward.
When taking an information gathering action, the reward is an arbitrary value such that optimizing (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) in the IBMDP is equivalent to optimizing some trade-off between \ref{def:mdp-obj} in the base MDP and interpretability.
 
Before showing how to get decision tree policies from IBMDP policies, we give a formal definition of IBMDPs following Topin et. al.~\cite{topin2021iterative}.

\begin{definition}[Iterative Bounding Markov decision process]\label{def:ibmdp}
Given a \textit{factored} MDP $\mathcal{M}$ $\langle S, A, R, T, T_0 \rangle$ (\ref{def:fmdp}), an associated iterative bouding Markov decision process $\mathcal{M}_{IB}$ is a tuple:
\begin{align*}
    \langle \overbrace{S \times O}^{\text{State space}}, \underbrace{A \cup A_{info}}_{\text{Action space}}, \overbrace{(R, \zeta)}^{\text{Reward function}}, \underbrace{(T_{info}, T, T_0)}_{\text{Transitions}}\rangle
\end{align*}

\begin{itemize}
\item $S$ is the base MDP factored state space. A state $\boldsymbol{s} = (s_1, \dots, s_n)\in S$ has $n$ bounded features $s_i \in [L_i, U_i]$ where $\infty < L_i \leq U_i < \infty \forall 1\leq i \leq n$.
\item $O$ are the observations in an IBMDP. They are partial information about the base MDP state features. The set of observations is the current features bounds: $O\subsetneq S^2 =  [L_1, U_1]\times \dots \times [L_n, U_n] \times [L_1, U_1]\times \dots \times [L_n, U_n]$. So the complete IBMDP state space is $S \times O$, the concatenations of base state features and observations.
\item $A$ is the base MDP actions set.
\item $A_{info}$ are \textit{information gathering} actions (IGAs) of the form $\langle i, v \rangle$ where $i$ is a state feature index $1 \leq i \leq n$ and $v$ is a real number. So the complete action space of an IBMDP is the set of base MDP actions and information gathering actions $A \cup A_{info}$.
\item $R: S\times A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is the base MDP reward function.
\item $\zeta$ is a reward signal for taking an information gathering action.
So the IBMDP reward function is to get a reward from the base MDP if the action is a base MDP action or to get $\zeta$ if the action is an IGA action.
\item $T_{info}: S\times O \times( A_{info} \cup A )\rightarrow \Delta (S\times O)$ is the transition kernel of IBMDPs: 
Given some observation $\boldsymbol{o}_t = (L'_1, U'_1, \dots, L'_n, U'_n) \in O$ and state features $\boldsymbol{s}_t=(s'_1, s'_2, \dots, s'_n)$ if an IGA $\langle i, v \rangle$ is taken, the new observation is:
\begin{align*}
    \boldsymbol{o}_{t+1} &= \begin{cases}
        (L'_1, U'_1, \dots , L'_i, \min\{v, U'_i\}, \dots , L''_n, U'_n) \text{ if } s_i \leq v\\
        (L'_1, U'_1, \dots , \max\{v, L'_i\}, U'_i, \dots , L''_n, U'_n) \text{ if } s_i > v
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
If a base action $a_t\in A$ is taken, the new observation is reset to the default state bounds $(L_1, U_1,\dots, L_n, U_n)$ and the state features change according to the base MDP transitition kernel: $\boldsymbol{s}_{t+1}\sim T(\boldsymbol{s}_t, a_t)$.
At initialization, the base state features are drawn from the base MDP $T_0$ and the observation is always set to the default state features bounds $\boldsymbol{o}_0=(L_1, U_1,\dots, L_n, U_n)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now remains to extract a decision tree policy for MDP $\mathcal{M}$ from a policy for an associated IBMDP $\mathcal{M}_{IB}$. 

\subsection{From Policies to Trees}

One can notice that information gathering actions (\ref{def:ibmdp}) resemble the Boolean functions that make up internal decision tree nodes (c.f. Figure \ref{fig:dt}).
Indeed, a policy taking actions in an IBMDP essentially builds a tree by taking sequences of IGAs (internal nodes) and then a base action in the base MDP (leaf node) and repeats this process over time.
In particular, the IGA rewards $\zeta$ can be seen as a regularization or a penalty for interpretabiliy: if $\zeta$ is very low compared to base rewards, a policy will try to act in the base MDP as often as possible, i.e. build shallow trees that short paths between root and leaves.

Authors from \cite{topin2021iterative} show that not all IBMDP policies are decision tree policies.
In particular, they show that only deterministic policies depending solely on the observation part of the IBMDP states are guaranteed to correspond to decision tree policies for the base MDP.
The intuition is that if one trains a policy $\pi:S\timesO\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$, the policy might learn to rely only on state features of the base MDP $\boldsymbol{s}$ and take only base actions (no IGAs) which would simply be any policy for the base MDP.

\begin{proposition}[Deterministic partially observable IBMDP policies are decision trees]\label{def:po-policy}
    Given a factored MDP $\mathcal{M}$ $\langle S, A, R, T, T_0\rangle$ (\ref{def:fmdp}) and an associated IBMDP $\mathcal{M}_{IB}$ $\langle S \times O,A \cup A_{info}, (R, \zeta), (T_{info}, T, T_0)\rangle$ (\ref{def:ibmdp}), a deterministic partially observable policy $\pi_{po}: O \rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ is a decision tree policy $\pi_{\mathcal{T}}: S \rightarrow A$ for the base MDP $\mathcal{M}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}(Sketch) Algorithm~\ref{alg:extract-tree} that takes as input a deterministic partially observable policy (\ref{def:po-policy}) for an IBMDP $\mathcal{M}_{IB}$ $\langle S \times O,A \cup A_{info}, (R, \zeta), (T_{info}, T, T_0)\rangle$ (\ref{def:ibmdp}), returns a decision tree policy $\pi_{\mathcal{T}}$ (\ref{def:dt}) for $\mathcal{M}$ $\langle S, A, R, T, T_0\rangle$ and always terminates unless the deterministic partially observable policy only takes IGAs.
\end{proof}

\begin{algorithm}[t]
    \KwData{Deterministic partially observable policy $\pi_{po}$ for IBMDP $ \langle S \times O,A \cup A_{info}, (R, \zeta), (T_{info}, T, T_0)\rangle$ and observation IBMDP $\boldsymbol{o}=(L'_1, U'_1, \dots, L'_n, U'_n)$}

        \If{$a \in A_{info}$}{
            \Return Leaf\_Node(action: $a$) \Comment{// Leaf if base action}
        }
        \Else{
            $\langle i, v\rangle \leftarrow a$ \Comment{// Splitting action is feature and value} \\
            $\boldsymbol{o}_L \leftarrow \boldsymbol{o}; \quad \boldsymbol{o}_R \leftarrow \boldsymbol{o}$ \\
                         $\boldsymbol{o}_L \leftarrow (L'_1, U'_1, \dots, L'_i, v, \dots, L'_n, U'_n); \quad \boldsymbol{o}_R \leftarrow (L'_1, U'_1, \dots, v, U'_i, \dots, L'_n, U'_n)$ \\
            $child_L \leftarrow$ Subtree\_From\_Policy$(\boldsymbol{o}_L, \pi_{po})$ \\
            $child_R \leftarrow$ Subtree\_From\_Policy$(\boldsymbol{o}_R, \pi_{po})$ \\
            \Return Internal\_Node(feature: $i$, value: $v$, children: $(child_L, child_R)$)
        }
    }
    \caption{Extract a Decision Tree Policy}\label{alg:extract-tree}
\end{algorithm}

While the connexions with partially observable MDPs~\cite{POMDP,chap2} is obvious, we defer the implications to Chapter \ref{sec:pomdp} as this connexion was not make in the original IBMDP paper~\cite{topin2021iterative}.
Next we present an example of an IBMDP policy that is a decision tree for the base MDP.

\subsection{Example: an IBMDP for a grid world}
For the sake of example, we re-formulate the example MDP (\ref{example:grid}) as a factored MDP with a finite number of vector valued states ($x,y$-coordinates).
The states are $S = \{(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), (1.5, 0.5)\}\subsetneq [0, 2] \times [0, 2]$.
The actions are the cardinal directions $A = \{\rightarrow, \leftarrow, \downarrow, \uparrow\}$ that shift the states by one as long as the coordinates remain in the grid.
The reward for taking any action is 0 except when in the bottom right state $(1.5, 0.5)$ which is an absorbing state: once in this state, you stay there forever. 
Optimal deterministic tabular policies were presented for this MDP in Example (\ref{example:grid}).

Suppose an associated IBMDP (\ref{def:ibmdp}) with two IGAs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\langle x, 1\rangle$ that tests if $x\leq 1$
    \item $\langle y, 1\rangle$ that tests if $y\leq 1$
\end{itemize}
The initial observation is always the grid bounds $\boldsymbol{o}_0=(0, 2, 0, 2)$ because a state in the grid world is always in $[0, 2] \times [0, 2]$.
There are only finitely many observations since with those two IGAs there are only nine possible observations that can be attained from $\boldsymbol{o}_0$ following the IBMDP transitions (\ref{def:ibmdp}).
For example when the IBMDP initial state features are $\boldsymbol{s}_0 = (0.5, 1.5)$, and taking first $\langle x, 1\rangle$ then $\langle y, 1\rangle$ the corresponding observations are first $\boldsymbol{o}_{t+1} = (0, 1, 0, 2)$ and then $\boldsymbol{o}_{t+2} = (0, 1, 1, 2)$.
The full observation set is $O = \{(0, 2, 0, 2), (0, 1, 0, 2), (0, 2, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0, 1), (1, 2, 0, 2), (1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1, 2), (0, 1, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1, 2)\}$.
The transitions and rewards are given by definition (\ref{def:ibmdp}).

In Figure (\ref{example:ibmdp}) we show a trajectory in this IBMDP.

The pink obstructions of the grid represent the current partial observations $\boldsymbol{o}_t$ of the state features.
When the pink covers the whole grid, the information contained in the observation is ``the current state could be anywhere in the grid''.
The more Information gathering actions are taken, the more refined the bounds on the current state features get.
At $t=0$, the state features are $\boldsymbol{s}_0 = (0.5, 1.5)$. 
The initial observation is always the base MDP default feature bounds, here $\boldsymbol{o}_0=(0, 2, 0, 2)$ because the base states are in $[0, 2] \times [0, 2]$.
The first action is an IGA that tests the feature $x$ of the states against the value $1$ and the reward $\zeta$. 
This transition corresponds to going through an internal node in a decision tree policy as illustrated in the figure. 
At $t=1$, after gathering the information that the $x$-value of the current base state is below 1, the observation is updated with the refined state bounds $\boldsymbol{o}_1=(0, 1, 0, 2)$, i.e. the pink area shrinks, and the base state features remain unchanged.
The agent then takes a base action that is to move right. 
This gives a reward 0, resets the observation to the original bounds, and changes the base state to $\boldsymbol{s}_2=(1.5, 1.5)$. And the trajectory continues like this until the agent reaches the absorbing base state $\boldsymbol{s}_5=(1.5, 0.5)$.}

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we presented the approach of Topin et. al.~\cite{topin2021iterative} to find decision tree policies that directly trade off interpretability and the RL objective (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) rather than the surrogate imitation loss (\ref{def:il}).
To achieve that Topin et. al. showed that partially observable deterministic policy in some MDP, an IBMDP (\ref{def:ibmdp}).

The promise of Topin et. al. is that optimizing (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) in an IBMDP trades off naturally the base MDP rewards and the interpretability of the policy through the reward signal $\zeta$.

We can thus write an interpretable RL objective as follows:
\begin{definition}[direct interpretable RL objective]\label{def:irl}
    Given a factored MDP $\mathcal{M} \langle S, A, R, T, T_0 \rangle$ for which we want an interpretable policy, e.g. a decision tree, a discount factor $\gamma \in (0,1]$, some interpretability penalty $\zeta$, and a set of information gathering actions $A_{info}$, we solve:
\begin{align*}
    \pi^\star_{po} &= \underset{\pi_{po}}{\opertarname{argmax}} \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R((\boldsymbol{s}_t, \boldsymbol{o}_t), a_t) \mid \boldsymbol{s}_0 \sim T_0, a_t = \pi_{po}(\boldsymbol{o}_t), \boldsymbol{s}_{t+1} \sim T(\boldsymbol{s}_t, a_t), \boldsymbol{o}_{t+1}\sim T(\boldsymbol{o_t}, a_t)\right]\\
    &= \underset{\pi_{po}}{\operatorname{argmax}} \mathbb{E}[V^{\pi_{po}}(s_0, o_0)| s_0\sim T_0]
\end{align*}
With $V^{\pi_{po}}$ the value function (\ref{def:vs}) of partially observable deterministic policy $\pi_{po}: O \rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ (\ref{def:po-policy}) in the IBMDP $\mathcal{M}_{IB}$ $\langle S \times O,A \cup A_{info}, (R, \zeta), (T_{info}, T, T_0)\rangle$ (\ref{def:ibmdp}).
\end{definition}

After optimizing objective (\ref{def:irl}) with, e.g. reinforcement learning, we thus use Algorithm \ref{alg:extract-tree} to obtain a decision tree policy that trades off between interpretability and the RL objectvie (\ref{def:mdp-obj}) for our MDP of intereset.
This is exactly what we do in the next chapters.
% In Figure (\ref{fig:summary-ibmdp}) we summarize the direct reinforcement learning approach of Topin et. al. that we use in the next chapters.
