\section{The classical Grid World Markov Decision Problem}
\subsection{The Grid World MDP}
We consider a 2×2 grid world Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{States}: Four cells labeled $S_0$, $S_1$, $S_2$, and $G$ (goal state) arranged in a 2×2 grid.
    \item \textbf{Actions}: At each state, the agent can move right ($\rightarrow$) or down ($\downarrow$) up ($\uparrow$) or left ($\leftarrow$).
    \item \textbf{Transitions}: Movements are deterministic, following the direction of the chosen action. Actions that would lead outside the grid leave the agent in the same state.
    \item \textbf{Rewards}: All transitions yield a reward of 0, except for any action taken from the goal state $G$, which yields a reward of 1.
    \item \textbf{Objective}: Maximize the expected discounted cumulative reward.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Some decision tree policies}

In this chapter, we explore different policy representations for the $2\times2$ grid world MDP shown in Figure~\ref{fig:grid-world}. The optimal policy for this environment can be represented in a tabular form, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:optimal-policy} where the optimal actions at each state are highlighted in green. This tabular policy directly maps each state to its optimal action: moving right from $S_0$, down from $S_1$ and $S_2$, and right from the goal state $G$ (which maximizes reward collection).

While the tabular representation is complete and precise, we are interested in more compact representations using decision trees. We present three different decision tree policies of varying complexity, as illustrated in Figures~\ref{fig:dt-simple},~\ref{fig:dt-complex}, and~\ref{fig:dt-trivial}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A simple decision tree based solely on the $y$-coordinate, demonstrating how a single-node decision tree might approximate the optimal policy.
    \item A more complex tree with decisions based first on the $x$-coordinate and then on the $y$-coordinate, showing how hierarchical decisions can better capture the optimal policy.
    \item A trivial single-action tree that always selects the rightward action, representing the simplest possible policy.
\end{enumerate}

These comparisons allow us to analyze the trade-off between policy complexity and performance. While decision trees may not always perfectly match the optimal tabular policy, they offer significant advantages in terms of interpretability, generalization potential, and computational efficiency.

\subsection{Value of the optimal policy}

\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        width=10cm,
        height=6cm,
        xlabel={$\gamma$},
        ylabel={$\zeta$},
        title={Bounds on $\zeta$},
        legend pos=north west,
        grid=major,
        grid style={gray!30},
    ]
    
    % Lower bound from data file
    \addplot[blue, thick] table[x=gamma, y=lower_bound] {zeta_bounds_data.dat};
    
    % Upper bound from data file  
    \addplot[red, thick] table[x=gamma, y=upper_bound] {zeta_bounds_data.dat};
    
    % Optional: fill between if you want the shaded region
    % \addplot[green!20, forget plot] fill between[of=A and B] restrict z to domain*={zeta_bounds_data.dat:valid==1};
    
    \legend{Lower bound, Upper bound}
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}

Figure illustrates how these bounds vary with the discount factor $\gamma$. For smaller values of $\gamma$, the bound from $J(T_0) \leq J(T_1)$ dominates, while for larger values of $\gamma$, the bound from $J(T_2) \leq J(T_1)$ becomes more restrictive.
