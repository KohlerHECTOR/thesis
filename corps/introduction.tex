\section{What is Sequential Decision Making?}
In this manuscript we are interested in sequential decision making processes. Sequential decision making processes are found in all aspects of life. In medicine, {\color{blue}doctors} have to decide when {\color{orange}to use chimiotherapy} next based on {\color{green} the patient's current health} in order {\color{red}to heal} (cite). In agriculture, agronomists have to decide when to fertilize next based on the current soil and wheather conditions in order to maximize plant growth (cite). In automotive, the auto-pilot system has to decide how to steer the wheel next in order to maintain a safe trajectory (cite). In video games, a bot decides what attack to throw next based on the player's and its states in order to provide the best entertainment (cite).
Those sequential decision making processes exhibits key similarities: {\color{blue}an agent} takes {\color{orange}actions} based on {\color{green}some current information} to achieve some {\color{red}goal}.
