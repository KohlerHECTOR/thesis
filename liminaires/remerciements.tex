I would like to thank my old and new friends for making those three years fun.
I would like to thank my partner Alëna for being so supportive and loving.
I would like to thank my family for encouraging me to pursue such an interesting career.
I would also like to thank all the teachers I got since I was a kid for transmitting their passion for science.
