\begin{abstract}
  For applications like medicine, machine learning models ought to be interpretable. In that case, models like decision trees are preferred over neural networks because humans can read their predictions from the root to the leaves.
  Learning such decision trees for sequential decision making problems is a relatively new research direction and most of the existing literature focuses on imitating (or distilling) neural networks.
  In contrast, we study reinforcement learning algorithms that \textit{directly} return decision trees optimizing some trade-off of cumulative rewards and interpretability in a Markov decision process (MDP). 
  We show that such algorithms can be seen as learning policies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).
  We use this parallel to understand why in practice it is often easier to use imitation learning than to learn the decision tree from scratch for MDPs.

\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}
The goal of this section is to check if the direct approach described above can consistently retrieve optimal decision tree policies for a simple  $2\times 2$ grid world MDP.
In particular, we use reinforcement learning to train decision tree policies for MDPs by seeking deterministic memoryless policies that optimize the RL objective in POIBMDPs (example~\ref{fig:ibmdp}).

\subsection{Computing some decision tree policies}
To assess the performance of reinforcement learning, we identify decision tree policies that maximize the RL objective in POIBMDPs with different trade-off rewards $\zeta$ for different discount factors $\gamma$.
Each of those policies can be one of the trees illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}: (i) a depth-0 tree equivalent to always taking the same downstream action ($\pi_{\mathcal{T}_0}$), (ii) a depth-1 tree equivalent alternating between an IGA and a downstream action ($\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}$), (iii) an unbalanced depth-2 tree that sometimes takes two IGAs then a downstream action and sometimes a an IGA then a downstream action ($\pi_{\mathcal{T}_u}$), (iv) a depth-2 tree that alternates between taking two IGAs and a downstream action ($\pi_{\mathcal{T}_2}$), or (v) an infinite ``tree'' that only takes IGAs.
Furthermore, because from~\citet{learning-pomdp} we know that for POMDPs, stochastic memoryless policies can sometimes get better expected discounted rewards than deterministic memoryless policies, we also compute the value of the stochastic policy that randomly alternates between two downstream actions: $\rightarrow$ and $\downarrow$.
Taking those two downstream actions always lead to the goal state in expectation (figure~\ref{fig:mdp-dt}).
Because we know all the downstream states, all the observations, all the actions, all the rewards and all the transitions of our POIBMDP (example~\ref{example:ibmdp}), using definiton~\ref{def:vpo}, we can compute exactly the values of those different deterministic memoryless policies given $\zeta$ the reward for IGAs and $\gamma$ the discount factor.

We plot, in figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}, the RL objective values of the decision tree policies as functions of $\zeta$ when we fix $\gamma=0.99$ (standard choice of discount in practice~\ref{sutton}). 
When $\gamma=0.99$, despite objective values being very similar for the depth-1 and unbalanced depth-2 tree, we now know from the green shaded area that a depth-1 tree is the optimal one, w.r.t. the RL objective, deterministic partially observable POIBMDP policy for $0< \zeta < 1$.
% Let us now define a POIBMDP with the grid world (figure~\ref{example:grid}) as the downstream MDP, with IGAs as in the IBMDP from example~\ref{example:ibmdp}, with $\gamma=0.99$ and $0<\zeta<1$ and verify if RL can learn the optimal deterministic memoryless policies w.r.t. the RL objective, which are equivalent to depth-1 decision tree policies, in this very controlled experiment.

\end{figure*}

Interestingly, those two challenges of learning in POMDPs described in \cite{learning-pomdp} are visible in figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}. 
First, there is a whole range of $\zeta$ values for which the optimal memoryless policy is stochastic.
Second, for e.g. $\zeta=0.5$, while a depth-1 tree is the optimal deterministic memoryless policy, the value of state $(\boldsymbol{s}_2, \boldsymbol{o}_0) = (1.5, 1.5, 0, 2, 0, 2)$ is not maximized by this memoryless policy but by the sub-optimal policy that always goes down.

\subsubsection{Experimental setup}

\paragraph{Baselines:} 
We also consider an asymmetric version of Sarsa that applies similar modifications to the standard Sarsa (algorithm~\ref{alg:sarsa}). We present asymmetric Sarsa in the appendix (algorithm~\ref{alg:asymsarsa}).
In~\cite{jsj}, the authors introduce a policy search algorithm~\ref{sec:rl} that learns a (stochastic) policy $\pi:O\rightarrow\Delta(A)$ and a critic $V:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ using Monte Carlo estimates to guide policy improvement.
We also consider this algorithm in our experiments that we call JSJ (for the authors names Jaakkola, Singh, Jordan). We present the JSJ algorithm in the appendix (algorithm~\ref{alg:jsj}).
JSJ is equivalent to a tabular asymmetric policy gradient algorithm (algorithm~\ref{alg:reinforce}). 

we consider two groups of RL algorithms.
The first group is standard tabular RL algorithms to optimize the interpretable RL objective in POIBMDPs; Q-learning, Sarsa, and Policy Gradient with a softmax policy (section~\ref{sec:rl}, algorithms~\ref{alg:qlearning},~\ref{alg:sarsa}, and~\ref{alg:reinforce}).
In theory the Policy Gradient algorithm should not be a good candidate for our problem since it searches for stochastic policies that we showed can be better than our sought depth-1 decision tree policy (figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}).

In addition to the traditional tabular RL algorithms above, we also apply asymmetric Q-learning, asymmetric Sarsa, and JSJ (algorithms~\ref{alg:asymqlearning},~\ref{alg:asymsarsa} and~\ref{alg:jsj}).
We use at least 200 000 POIBMDP time steps per experiment. Each experiment, i.e an RL algorithm learning in a POIBMDP, is repeated 100 times.  

\paragraph{Hyperparameters:} For all baselines we use, when applicable, exploration rates $\epsilon=0.3$ and learning rates $\alpha=0.1$.

\paragraph{Metrics:} We will consider two metrics.
First, the sub-optimality gap during training, w.r.t. the interpretable RL objective, between the learned memoryless policy and the optimal deterministic memoryless policy: $|\mathbb{E}\left[V^\pi^{\star}(\boldsymbol{s}_0,\boldsymbol{o}_0)| \boldsymbol{s}_0\sim T_0\right] - \mathbb{E}\left[V^\pi(\boldsymbol{s}_0,\boldsymbol{o}_0)|\boldsymbol{s}_0\sim T_0\right]|$.
Because we know the whole POIBMDP model that we can represent exactly as tables, and because we know for each $\zeta$ the interpretable RL objective value of the optimal deterministic memoryless policy (figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}), we can report the \textit{exact} sub-optimality gaps.

Second, we consider the distribution of the learned trees over the 100 training seeds.
Indeed, since for every POIBMDP we run each algorithm 100 times, at the end of training we get 100 deterministic memoryless policies (we compute the greedy policy for stochastic policies returned by JSJ and Policy Gradient), from which we can extract the equivalent 100 decision tree policies using algorithm~\ref{alg:extract-tree} and we can count which one are of e.g. depth 1.
This helps understand which trees RL algorithms tend to learn.


\section{Results}\label{sec:experiments}

The results presented in the section show that (asymmetric) reinforcement learning fails for the aforementioned problem. Let us understand why.

\subsection{Can (asymmetric) RL learn optimal deterministic partially observable POIBMDP policies?}

In figure~\ref{fig:rl-poibmdp}, we plot the sub-optimality gaps--averaged over 100 seeds--of learned policies during training.
We do so for 200 different POIBMDPs where we change the reward for information gathering actions: we sample 200 $\zeta$ values uniformly in $[-1, 2]$.
In figure~\ref{fig:rl-poibmdp}, a different color represents a different POIBMDP.

Recall from figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives} that for: (i) $\zeta\in [-1, 0]$, the optimal deterministic memoryless policy is a depth-0 tree, (ii) $\zeta\in ]0, 1[$, the optimal deterministic memoryless policy is a depth-1 tree, and (iii) $\zeta\in [1, 2]$, the optimal deterministic memoryless policy is a ``infinite'' tree that contains infinite number of internal nodes.
We observe that, despite all sub-optimality gaps converging independently of the $\zeta$ values, not all algorithms in all POIBMDPs fully minimize the sub-optimality gap.
In particular, all algorithms seem to consistently minimize the gap, i.e. learn the optimal policy or Q-function, only for $\zeta \in [1, 2]$ (all the yellow lines go to 0).
However, we are interested in the range $\zeta\in ]0, 1[$ where the optimal decision tree policy is non-trivial, i.e. not taking the same action forever.
In that range, no baseline consistently minimizes the sub-optimality gap.


In figure~\ref{fig:dt-distrib-poibmdp}, we plot the distributions of the final learned trees over the 100 random seeds in function of $\zeta$ from the above runs.
For example, in figure~\ref{fig:dt-distrib-poibmdp}, in the top left plot, when learning 100 times in a POIBMDP with $\zeta=0.5$, Q-learning returned almost 100 times a depth-0 tree.
Again, on none of those subplots do we see a high rate of learned depth-1 trees for $\zeta\in ]0, 1[$.
It is alerting that the most frequent learned trees are the depth-0 trees for $\zeta\in ]0, 1[$ because such trees are way more sub-optimal w.r.t. the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl}) than e.g. the depth-2 unbalanced trees (figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}).  
One interpretation of this phenomenon is that the learning in POIBMDPs is very difficult and so agents tend to converge to trivial policies, e.g., repeating the same downstream action.

However, on the positive side, we observe that asymmetric versions of Q-learning and Sarsa have found the optimal deterministic memoryless policy--the depth-1 decision tree--more frequently throughout the optimality range $]0,1[$, than their symmetric counter-parts for $\zeta\in ]0, 1[$.
Next, we quantify how difficult it is to do RL to learn memoryless policies in POIBMDPs.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../slides_soutenance/tree_distributions.pdf}
    \caption{Distributions of final tree policies learned across the 100 seeds.
    For each $\zeta$ value, there are four colored points. Each point represent the share of depth-0 trees (red), depth-1 trees (green), unbalanced depth-2 trees (orange) and depth-2 trees (blue).
    }\label{fig:dt-distrib-poibmdp}
\end{figure}


\subsection{How difficult is it to learn in POIBMDPs?}\label{sec:how-diff}

In this section we run the same (asymmetric) reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize either the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) in MDPs (definition~\ref{def:mdp}) or IBMDPs (definition~\ref{def:ibmdp}), or the interpretable RL objective in POIBMDPs(definition~\ref{def:irl}).
This essentially results in three distinct problems: (i) learning an optimal standard Markovian policy in an MDP, (ii) learning an optimal standard Markovian policy in an IBMDP, and (iii) learning an optimal deterministic memoryless policy in a POIBMDP.

In order to see how difficult each of these three problems is, we can run a \textit{great} number of experiments for each problem and compare solving rates.
To make solving rates comparable we consider a unique instance for each of those problems.
Problem 1 is learning one of the optimal standard Markovian deterministic policy from figure~\ref{example:grid} for the grid world from example~\ref{example:grid} with $\gamma=0.99$.
Problem 2 is learning one of the optimal standard Markovian deterministic for the IBMDP from figure~\ref{example:ibmdp} with $\gamma=0.99$ and $\zeta=0.5$.
This is similar to the previous chapter experiments where we applied DQN or PPO to an IBMDP for CartPole without constraining the search to memoryless policies (see e.g. figure\ref{fig:res-ppo}).
Problem 3 is what has been done in the previous section to learn deterministic memoryless policies where in addition of fixing $\gamma=0.99$ we also fix $\zeta=0.5$.

We use the six (asymmetric) RL algorithms from the previous section and try a wide set of hyperparameters and additional learning tricks (optimistic Q-function, eligibility traces, entropy regularization and $\epsilon$-decay, all are described in \cite{sutton}).
We only provide the detailed hyperparameters for asymmetric Sarsa and an overall summary for all the algorithms in tables~\ref{tab:hp-sarsa} and~\ref{tab:ib-params}.
The complete detailed lists of hyperparameters are given in the appendix~\ref{sec:hp-pomdp}.
Furthermore, the careful reader might notice that there is no point running asymmetric RL on MDPs or IBMDPs when the problem does not require partial observability.
Hence, we only run asymmetric RL for POIBMDPs and otherwise run all other RL algorithms and all problems.

Each unique hyperparameter combination for a given algorithm on a given problem is run 10 times on 1 million learning steps.
For example, for asymmetric Sarsa, we run a total of $10\times 768= 7680$ experiments for learning deterministic memoryless policies for a POIBMDP (table~\ref{tab:hp-sarsa}).
To get a success rate, we can simply divide the number of learned depth 1 tree by 7680 (recall that for $\gamma=0.99$ and $\zeta=0.5$, the optimal policy is a depth-1 tree (e.g. figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}) as per figure~\ref{fig:irl-objectives}). 

\begin{table}
    \centering
    \caption{Summary of RL baselines Hyperparameters}\label{tab:ib-params}

    \begin{tabular}{llr}
    \toprule

    Asym Sarsa & POIBMDP & 768 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}


The key observations from figure~\ref{fig:po-vs-ib} is that reinforcement learning a deterministic memoryless policy in a POIBMDP, is way harder than learning a standard Markovian policy.
For example, Q-learning only finds the optimal solution (definition~\ref{def:irl}) in only 3\% of the experiments while the same algorithms to optimize the standard RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) in an MDP or IBMDP found the optimal solutions 50\% of the time.
Even though asymmetry seems to increase performances; learning a decision tree policy for a simple grid world directly with RL using the framework of POIBMDP originally developed in~\cite{topin2021iterative} seems way too difficult and costly as successes might require a million steps for such a seemingly simple problem.
An other difficulty in practice that we did not cover here, is the choice of information gathering actions.
For the grid world MDP, choosing good IGAs ($x\leq1$ and $y\leq1$) is simple but what about more complicated MDPs: how to instantiate the (PO)IBMDP action space such that internal nodes in resulting trees are useful for predictions?

To go even further, on figure~\ref{fig:asym-ql-analysis} we re-run experiments from figure~\ref{fig:rl-poibmdp} and figure~\ref{fig:dt-distrib-poibmdp} using the top performing hyperparameters for asymmetric Q-learning (given in appendix~\ref{tab:algorithm-hyperparameters}).
While those hyperparameters resulted in asymmetric Q-learning returning 10 of out 10 times an optimal depth 1 tree,
the performances didn't transfer.
On figure~\ref{fig:asym-ql-analysis} despite higher success rates in the region $\zeta\in]0,1[$ compared to figure~\ref{fig:dt-distrib-poibmdp}.

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have shown that direct learning of decision tree policies for MDPs can be reduced to learning deterministic memoryless policies in POMDPs that we called POIBMDPs.
By crafting a POIBMDP for which we know exactly the optimal deterministic memoryless policy w.r.t. the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl}), we were able to benchmark the sub-optimality of solutions learned with (asymmetric) reinforcement learning.

Across our experiments, we found that no algorithm could consistently learn a depth-1 decision tree policy for a grid world MDP despite it being optimal both w.r.t. the interpretable RL objective and standard RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}).
When compared to the results of VIPER from figure~\ref{fig:ql-il}, direct RL is worse at retrieving decision tree policies with good interpretability-performance trade-offs.
This echoes the results from the previous chapter in which we saw that direct deep RL performed worse than imitation learning to find decision tree policies for CartPole.

In the next chapter, we find that RL can find optimal deterministic memoryless policies for a special class of POIBMDPs that we believe makes for a convincing argument as to why direct learning of decision tree policies that optimize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) is so difficult.

\section{Classification tasks}
In this section, we show that for a special class of POIBMDPs (definition~\ref{def:poibmdp}), reinforcement learning (section~\ref{sec:rl}) can learn optimal deterministic memoryless policies w.r.t to the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl}), i.e. we can do direct decision tree policy learning for MDPs.
This class of POIBMDPs are those for which downstream MDPs have uniform transitions, i.e. $T(\boldsymbol{s}, a, \boldsymbol{s}') = \frac{1}{|S|}$ (definitions~\ref{def:mdp} and~\ref{def:ibmdp}).
The supervised learning objective (definition~\ref{def:sl}) can be re-formulated in terms of the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) and MDPs with such uniform transitions.
Indeed a supervised learning task can be formulated as maximizing the RL objective in an MDP where, actions are class (or target) labels, states are training data, the reward at every step is 1 if the correct label was predicted and 0 otherwise, and the transitions are uniform: the next state is given by uniformly sampling a new training datum. 
This implies that learning deterministic memoryless policies in POIBMDPs where the downstream MDP encodes a supervised learning task is equivalent to doing decision tree induction to optimize the supervised learning objective.
If RL does work for such fully observable POIBMDPs, this would mean that: 1) the difficulty of direct learning of decision tree policies for \textit{any} MDP using POIBMDPs, exhibited in the previous chapters, is most likely due to the partial observability, and 2), we can design new decision tree induction algorithms for the supervised learning objective by solving MDPs.
Let us show that, POIBMDPs associated with MDPs encoding supervised learning tasks, are in fact MDPs themselves.
Let us define such supervised learning MDPs in the context of a classification task (this definition extends trivially to regression tasks).
\begin{definition}[Classification Markov decision process]\label{def:cmdp}
    Given a set of $N$ examples denoted $\mathcal{E} = {\{(\boldsymbol{x}_i, y_i)\}}_{i=1}^N$ where each datum $\boldsymbol{x}_i \in \mathcal{X}$ is described by a set of $p$ features $x_{ij}$ with $1\leq j \leq p$, and $y_i \in \mathbb{Z}^m$ is the label associated with $\boldsymbol{x}_i$, a classification Markov decision Process is an MDP $\langle S, A, R, T, T_0 \rangle$ (definition~\ref{def:mdp}).
    The state space is $S={\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}}_{i=1}^N$, the set of training data features.
    The action space is $A=\mathbb{Z}^m$, the set of unique labels.
    The reward function is $R:S\times A \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ with $R(\boldsymbol{s}=\boldsymbol{x}_i, a) = 1_{\{a=y_i\}}$.
    The transition function is $T:S\times A \rightarrow \Delta(S)$ with $T(\boldsymbol{s}, a, \boldsymbol{s}') = \frac{1}{N} \quad \forall \boldsymbol{s}, a, \boldsymbol{s}'$.
    The initial distribution is $T_0(\boldsymbol{s}_0 = \boldsymbol{s}) = \frac{1}{N}$.
\end{definition}

One can be convinced that policies that maximize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) in classification MDPs are classifiers that maximize the prediction accuracy because $\sum_{i=1}^N 1_{\pi(\boldsymbol{x}_i)=y_i} = \sum_{i=1}^N R(\boldsymbol{x}_i, \pi(\boldsymbol{x}_i))$.
We defer the formal proof in the next part of the manuscript in which we extensively study supervised learning problems.

In figure~\ref{example:cmdp} we give an example of such classification MDP with 4 data in the training set and 2 classes: $\mathcal{X} &= \{(0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), (1.5, 0.5)\}$ and $y &= \{0, 0, 1, 1\}$.

    \end{figure}

Now let us show that associated POIBMDPs are in fact MDPs. We show this by construction.

\begin{definition}[Classification POIBMDP]\label{def:cpoibmdp}
    Given a classification MDP $\langle {\{\boldsymbol{x}_i\}}_{i=1}^N, \mathbb{Z}^m, R, T, T_0 \rangle$ (definition~\ref{def:cmdp}), and an associated POIBMDP $\langle S, O, A, A_{info}, R, \zeta, T_{info}, T, T_0\rangle$ (definition~\ref{def:poibmdp}), a classification POIBMDP is an MDP (definition~\ref{def:mdp}):
    \begin{align*}
        \langle \overbrace{O}^{\text{State space}}, \overbrace{\mathbb{Z}^m, A_{info}}^{\text{Action space}}, \overbrace{R, \zeta}^{\text{Reward function}}, \overbrace{\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{P}_0}^{\text{Transition functions}} \rangle
    \end{align*}
    $O$ is the set of possible observations in $[L_1, U_1] \times \dots \times [L_p, U_p] \times [L_1, U_1] \times \dots \times [L_p, U_p] $ where $L_j$ is the minimum value of feature $j$ over all data $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ and $U_j$ the maximum.
    $\mathbb{Z}^m \cup A_{info}$ is action space: actions can be label assignments in $\mathbb{Z}^m$ or bounds refinements in $A_{info}$.
    The reward for assigning label $a\in \mathbb{Z}^m$ when observing some observation $\boldsymbol{o}=(L'_1, U'_1, \dots,$ $L'_p, U'_p)$ is the proportion of training data satisfying the bounds and having label $a$: $R(o, a) = \frac{|\{\boldsymbol{x}_i: L'_j \leq x_{ij} \leq U'_j \forall i,j \} \cap \{\boldsymbol{x}_i: y_i = a \forall i \}|}{|\{\boldsymbol{x}_i: L'_j \leq x_{ij} \leq U'_j \forall i,j \}|}$. 
    The reward for taking an information gathering action that refines bounds is $\zeta$.
    The transition function is $\mathcal{P}:O \times (\mathbb{Z}^m \cup A_{info}) \rightarrow \Delta (O)$. When $a \in \mathbb{Z}^m$, $\mathcal{P}(\boldsymbol{o}, a, (L_1, U_1, \dots, L_p, U_p)) = 1$ (reset to full bounds).
    When $a = (k, v) \in A_{info}$, from $\boldsymbol{o}=(L'_1, U'_1, \dots, L'_p, U'_p)$, the MDP will transit to $\boldsymbol{o}_{left} = (L'_1, U'_1, \dots, L_k, v, \dots, L'_p, U'_p)$ (resp. $\boldsymbol{o}_{right} = (L'_1, U'_1, \dots, U'_k, v, \dots, L'_p, U'_p)$) with probability $\frac{|\{\boldsymbol{x}_i: L'_j \leq x_{ij} \leq U'_j \forall j \land x_{ik} \leq v\}|}{|\{\boldsymbol{x}_i: L'_j \leq x_{ij} \leq U'_j \forall j\}|}$ (resp. $\frac{|\{\boldsymbol{x}_i: L'_j \leq x_{ij} \leq U'_j \forall j \land x_{ik} > v\}|}{|\{\boldsymbol{x}_i: L'_j \leq x_{ij} \leq U'_j \forall j\}|}$).
\end{definition}

Those classification POIBMDPs are essentially MDPs with stochastic transitions.
It means that deterministic memoryless policies (definition~\ref{def:po-policy}) $O:\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ are in fact Markovian policy for those classification POIBMDPs.
More importantly, it means that, for a given $\gamma$ and $\zeta$, if we were to know the whole POIBMDP model, we could use planning, e.g. value iteration (definition~\ref{alg:value-iteration}), to compute \textit{optimal} decision tree policies.
Similarly, standard RL algorithms like Q-learning (definition~\ref{sec:rl}) should work as well as for any MDP to learn optimal decision tree policies.

This is exactly what we check next.
We use the same direct approach to learn decision tree policies as in previous chapters, except that now the downstream MDP is a classification task and not a sequential decision making task.

\section{How well do RL agents learn in classification POIBMDPs?}
Similarly to the previous chapter, we are interested in a very simple classification POIBMDP.
We study classification POIBMDPs associated with the example classification MDP from figure~\ref{example:cmdp}.

We construct classification POIBMDPs with $\gamma=0.99$, 200 values of $\zeta \in [0,1]$ and IGAs $x\leq 1$ and $y\leq 1$.
Since classification POIBMDPs are MDPs, we do not need to analyze asymmetric RL and JSJ baselines like in the previous chapter (algorithms~\ref{alg:asymqlearning},~\ref{alg:asymsarsa}, and~\ref{alg:jsj}).

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{../slides_soutenance/tree_distributions_merged.pdf}
    \caption{We reproduce the same plot as in figure~\ref{fig:dt-distrib-poibmdp} for classification POIBMDPs. Each colored dot is the number of final learned trees with a specific structure for a given $\zeta$.}\label{fig:tree-distrib-classif-poibmdp}
\end{figure}

Fortunately this time, compared to general POIBMDPs, RL can be used to learn optimal deterministic memoryless policies $O:\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ w.r.t. the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl}) in classification POIBMDPs.
Such policies are equivalent to decision tree classifiers.
We observe on figure~\ref{fig:rl-classif-poibmdp} that both Q-learning and Sarsa consistently minimize the sub-optimality gap independently of the interpretability-performance trade-off $\zeta$. 
Hence they are able to learn the optimal depth-1 decision tree classifier (figure~\ref{example:cmdp}) most of the time in the optimality range $\zeta\in ]0, 1[$ (figure~\ref{fig:tree-distrib-classif-poibmdp}).


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:ccl-pomdp}
In this part of the manuscript we were interested in algorithms that can learn decision tree policies that optimize some trade-off of interpretability and performance w.r.t. the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) in MDPs.
In particular, using the framework of Topin et. al.~\cite{topin2021iterative}, we were able to explicitly write an interpretable RL objective function (definition~\ref{def:irl}).

In chapter~\ref{sec:topin}, we compared the algorithms proposed in~\cite{topin2021iterative} that directly optimize this objective, to imitation learning algorithms that only solve a proxy problem.
While those direct RL algorithms are able to \textit{learn}, i.e. find better and better solutions with time (figures~\ref{fig:res-dqn} and~\ref{fig:res-ppo}), the decision tree policies returned perform worse in average than imitated decision trees w.r.t. the RL objective of interest (figure~\ref{fig:ppo-trees}) for similar number of nodes and depth.

We further analyzed the failure mode of direct learning of decision tree policies by making connections with POMDPs~\cite{POMDP,chap2}.
In chapter~\ref{sec:pomdp}, we showed that learning decision tree policies for MDPs could be explicitly formulated as learning a deterministic partially observable (also known as memoryless or reactive) policy in a specific POMDP that we called POIBMDP (definition~\ref{def:poibmdp}).
We showed that both RL and asymmetric RL, a class of algorithms specifically designed for POMDPs~\cite{baisero-ppo,baisero-dqn}, were unable to consistently learn an optimal depth-1 decision tree policies for a very small grid world MDP when using the POIBMDP framework.
In particular, we compared, in a very controlled experiment, the success rates of the same learning algorithms when seeking standard Markovian policies versus memoryless policies in decision processes that shared the same transitions and rewards (section~\ref{sec:how-diff}).
We demonstrated on figure~\ref{fig:po-vs-ib} that introducing partial observability greatly reduced the success rates (we also observed this implicitly on figures~\ref{fig:res-dqn} and~\ref{fig:res-ppo}).  

Finally, in this chapter we showed that using RL to optimize the interpretable RL objective in fully observable POIBMDPs, i.e. POIBMDPs that are just MDPs, could learn optimal decision tree policies (figures~\ref{fig:rl-classif-poibmdp} and~\ref{fig:tree-distrib-classif-poibmdp}) adding new evidence that direct interpretable RL is difficult because it involves POMDPs.

This class of fully observable POIBMDPs (definition~\ref{def:cpoibmdp}) contains the decision tree induction problem for supervised learning tasks (definition~\ref{def:sl}).
This sparks the question: what kind of decision tree induction algorithm can we get using the MDP formalism?
This is exactly what we study in the next part of this manuscript.

Those few chapters raise other interesting questions.
We focused on non-parametric tree learning because RL algorithms can learn decision tree policies with potentially optimal interpretability-performance trade-offs through the reward of information gathering actions in (PO)IBMDPs (definitions~\ref{def:ibmdp} and~\ref{def:poibmdp}).
However this comes at a cost of partial observability which makes learning difficult. 
Parametric tree policies on the other hand, can be computed with reinforcement learning directly in the downstream MDP.
However existing RL algorithms for parametric decision tree policies~\cite{silva,vos2024optimizinginterpretabledecisiontree,sympol} require to re-train a policy entirely for each desired level of interpretability, i.e. each unique tree structure, future research in this direction should focus on algorithms for parametric tree policies that can re-use samples from one tree learning to train a different tree structure more efficiently.
This would reduce the required quantity of a priori knowledge on the decision tree policy structure mentioned in section~\ref{related-work-pomdp}.

Attempting to overcome the partial observability challenges highlighted so far seems like a bad research direction.
Indeed, while algorithms tailored specifically for the problem of learning deterministic memoryless policies for POIBMDPs might exist, we clearly saw that imitation learning was in practice a good alternative to direct interpretable reinforcement learning.
Some limitations that we did not cover still exist such as how to choose good candidates information gathering actions or simply how to choose $\zeta$ for a target interpretability-performance trade-off.

\section{Appendix for technical perliminaries}

\subsection{Reinforcement learning of approximate solutions to MDPs}\label{sec:rl}
When the MDP transition function and reward function are unknown, one can use reinforcement learning algorithms--also known as agents--to learn values or policies maximizing the RL objective. 
Reinforcement learning algorithms popularized by Richard Sutton~\cite{sutton} don't \textbf{compute} an optimal policy but rather \textbf{learn} an approximate one based on sequences of transitions $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1})_t$.
RL algorithms usually fall into two categories: value-based~\cite{sutton} and policy search~\cite{pg_sutton}.
Examples of these approaches are shown in algorithms~\ref{alg:qlearning},~\ref{alg:sarsa} and~\ref{alg:reinforce}.
Q-learning and Sarsa compute an approximation of $Q^{\star}$ (definition~\ref{def:qvalues}) using temporal difference learning~\cite{sutton}. Q-learning is \textit{off-policy}: it collects new transitions with a random policy, e.g. epsilon-greedy. Sarsa is \textit{on-policy}: it collects new transitions greedily w.r.t. the current Q-values estimates.
Policy gradient algorithms~\cite{pg_sutton} leverage the policy gradient theorem to approximate $\pi^{\star}$.

Q-learning, Sarsa, and policy gradients algorithms are known to converge to the optimal value or (locally) optimal policy under some conditions.
There are many other ways to learn policies such as simple random search~\cite{random-search} or model-based reinforcement learning that estimates MDP transitions and rewards before applying e.g. value iteration~\cite{ucbvi}. 
Those RL algorithms--also known as tabular RL because they represent policies as tables with $|S|\times |A|$ entries--are limited to small state spaces.
To scale to large state spaces, it is common to use a neural network to represent policies or values~\cite{tdgammon}.
In the next section, we present deep reinforcement learning algorithms designed specifically for neural networks.

\subsection{Deep reinforcement learning}
Reinforcement learning has also been successfully combined with function approximations to solve MDPs with large discrete state spaces or continuous state spaces ($S\subset \mathbb{R}^p$ in definition~\ref{def:mdp}).
In the rest of this manuscript, unless stated otherwise, we write $\boldsymbol{s}$ a state vector in a continuous state space\footnote{Note that discrete states can be one-hot encoded as state vectors in $\{0, 1\}^{|S|}$.}.

Deep Q-Networks (DQN)~\cite{dqn}, described in algorithm~\ref{alg:dqn} achieved super-human performance on a set of Atari games.
Authors successfully extended the Q-learning (algorithm~\ref{alg:qlearning}) to the function approximation setting by introducing target networks to mitigate distributional shift in the temporal difference error and replay buffer to increase sample efficiency.

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)~\cite{ppo}, described in algorithm~\ref{alg:ppo}, is an actor-critic algorithm~\cite{sutton} optimizing a neural network policy. 
In actor-critic algorithms, cumulative discounted rewards starting from a particular state, also known as \textit{the returns}, are also estimated with a neural network. 
PPO is known to work well in a variety of domains including robot control in simulation among others.


\section{Imitation learning: a baseline for indirect decision tree policy learning}\label{sec:imit}

\subsection{What is imitation learning?}
Unlike PPO or DQN for neural networks, there exists no algorithm that trains decision tree policies to optimize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}).
In fact, we will show in the first part of the manuscript that training decision trees that optimize the RL objective is very difficult.

Hence, many interpretable reinforcement learning approaches first train a neural network policy--also called an expert policy--to optimize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) using e.g. PPO, and then fit a student policy such as a decision tree using CART (algorithm~\ref{alg:cart}) to optimize the supervised learning objective (definition~\ref{def:sl}) with the neural policy actions as targets.
This approach is known as imitation learning and is essentially training a student policy to optimize the objective:

\begin{definition}[Imitation learning objective]\label{def:il}
Given an MDP $\mathcal{M}$ (definition~\ref{def:mdp}), an expert policy $\pi^*$ and a policy class $\Pi$, e.g. decision trees of depth at most 3, the imitation learning objective is to find a student policy $\hat{\pi} \in \Pi$ that minimizes the expected action disagreement with the expert:
\begin{equation}
IL(\pi) = \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{s} \sim \rho(\boldsymbol{s})} \left[ \mathcal{L}(\pi(\boldsymbol{s}), \pi^*(\boldsymbol{s})) \right]
\end{equation}
where $\rho(\boldsymbol{s})$ is the state distribution in $\mathcal{M}$ induced by the student policy $\pi$ and $\mathcal{L}$ is a loss function measuring the disagreement between the student policy's action $\pi(s)$ and the expert's action $\pi^*(s)$.
\end{definition}

There are two main imitation learning methods used for interpretable reinforcement learning.
Dagger (algorithm~\ref{alg:dagger}) is a straightforward way to fit a decision tree policy to optimize the imitation learning objective (definition~\ref{def:il}).
VIPER (algorithm~\ref{alg:viper}) was designed specifically for interpretable reinforcement learning.
VIPER re-weights the transitions collected by the neural network expert by a function of the state-action value (definition~\ref{sec:values}).
The authors of VIPER showed that decision tree policies fitted with VIPER tend to have the same RL objective value as Dagger trees while being more interpretable (shallower or with fewer nodes) and sometimes outperform Dagger trees.
Dagger and VIPER are two strong baselines for decision tree learning in MDPs, but they optimize a surrogate objective only, even though in practice the resulting decision tree policies often achieve high RL objective value.
We use these two algorithms extensively throughout the manuscript.
Next we show how to learn a decision tree policy for the example MDP (figure~\ref{example:grid}).

\subsection{Your first decision tree policy}\label{sec:limits-il}
Now the reader should know how to train decision tree classifiers or regressors for supervised learning using CART (section~\ref{sec:sl}).
The reader should also know what an MDP is and how to compute or learn policies that optimize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) with (deep) reinforcement learning (section~\ref{sec:drl}).
Finally, the reader should now know how to obtain a decision tree policy for an MDP through imitation learning (definition~\ref{def:il}) by first using RL to get an expert policy and then fitting a decision tree to optimize the supervised learning objective, using the expert actions as labels.

In this section we present the first decision tree policies of this manuscript obtained using Dagger or VIPER after learning an expert Q-function for the grid world MDP from figure~\ref{example:grid} using Q-learning (algorithm~\ref{alg:qlearning}).
Recall the optimal policies for the grid world, taking the green actions in each state in figure~\ref{example:grid}. 
Among the optimal policies, the ones that go left or up in the goal state can be problematic for imitation learning algorithms.
Indeed, we know that for this grid world MDP there exists decision tree policies with a very good interpretability-performance trade-off: depth-1 decision trees that are optimal w.r.t. the RL objective.
One could even say that those trees have the \textit{optimal} interpretability-performance trade-off because they are the shortest trees that are optimal w.r.t. the RL objective.

In figure~\ref{fig:trees-intro}, we present a depth-1 decision tree policy that is optimal w.r.t. the RL objective and a depth-1 tree that is sub-optimal.
The other optimal depth-1 tree is to go right when $y\leq 1$ and down otherwise.
Indeed, figure~\ref{fig:objectives} shows that the optimal depth-1 tree achieves exactly the same RL objective value as the optimal policies from figure~\ref{example:grid}, independently of the discount factor $\gamma$.

Now a fair question is: can Dagger or VIPER learn such an optimal depth-1 tree given access to an expert optimal policy from figure~\ref{example:grid}?

We start by running the standard Q-learning algorithm as presented in algorithm~\ref{alg:qlearning} with $\epsilon=0.3$, $\alpha=0.1$ over 10,000 time steps.
The careful reader might wonder how ties are broken in the $\operatorname{argmax}$ operation from algorithm~\ref{alg:qlearning}.
While Sutton and Barto break ties by index value in their book~\cite{sutton} (the greedy action is the $\operatorname{argmax}$ action with smallest index), we show that the choice of tie-breaking greatly influences the performance of subsequent imitation learning algorithms.
Indeed, depending on how actions are ordered in practice, Q-learning may be biased toward some optimal policies rather than others.
While this does not matter for one who just wants to find an optimal policy, in our example of finding the optimal depth-1 decision tree policy, it matters \textit{a lot}.

In the left plot of figure~\ref{fig:ql-il}, we see that Q-learning, independently of how ties are broken, consistently converges to an optimal policy over 100 runs (random seeds).
However, in the right plot of figure~\ref{fig:ql-il}, where we plot the proportion over 100 runs of optimal decision trees returned by Dagger or VIPER at different stages of Q-learning, we observe that imitating the optimal policy obtained by breaking ties at random consistently yields more optimal trees than breaking ties by indices.
What actually happens is that the most likely output of Q-learning when ties are broken by indices is the optimal policy that goes left in the goal state,
which cannot be perfectly represented by a depth-1 decision tree, because there are three different actions taken and a binary tree of depth $D=1$ can only map to $2^D=2$ labels.

This short experiment shows that imitation learning approaches can sometimes be very bad at learning decision tree policies with good interpretability-performance trade-offs for very simple MDPs. 
Despite VIPER almost always finding the optimal depth-1 decision tree policy in terms of the RL objective when ties are broken at random, we have shed light on the sub-optimality of indirect approaches such as imitation learning.
This motivates the study of direct approaches (figure~\ref{fig:direct-vs-indirect-methods}) to directly search for policies with good interpretability-performance trade-offs with respect to the original RL objective.

\section{Reproducing ``Iterative Bounding MDPs: Learning Interpretable Policies via Non-Interpretable Methods''}\label{sec:reprod}
We attempt to reproduce the results from~\cite{topin2021iterative} in which authors compare direct and indirect learning of decision tree policies of depth at most 2 for the CartPole MDP~\cite{cartpole}.
In the original paper, the authors find that both direct and indirect learning yields decision tree policies with similar RL objective values (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) for the CartPole.
On the other hand, we find that, imitation learning, despite not directly optimizing the RL objective for CartPole, outperforms deep RL that optimizes the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl} in which the objective trades off the standard RL objective and interpretability).

Authors of~\citet{topin2021iterative} use two deep reinforcement learning baselines (section~\ref{sec:drl}) to which they apply some modifications in order to learn memoryless policies as required by proposition \ref{def:po-policy} and by the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl}).
Authors modify the standard DQN (algorithm~\ref{alg:dqn}) to return a memoryless policy. The trained $Q$-function is approximated with a neural network $O\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|A\cup A_{info}|}$ rather than $S\times O\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|A\cup A_{info}|}$.
In this modified DQN, the temporal difference error target for the $Q$-function $O\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ is approximated by a neural network $S\times O\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ that is in turn trained by bootstrapping the temporal difference error with itself.
We present the modifications in algorithm~\ref{alg:mod-dqn}.
Similar modifications are applied to the standard PPO (algorithm~\ref{alg:ppo}) that we present in the appendix (algorithm \ref{alg:mod-ppo}). In the modified PPO, neural network policy $O\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ is trained using a neural network value function $S\times O\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ as a critic.

Those two variants of DQN and PPO have first been introduced in \cite{pinto} for robotic tasks with partially observable components, under the name ``asymmetric'' actor-critic. 
Asymmetric RL algorithms that have policy and value estimates using different information from a POMDP~\cite{POMDP,chap2} were later studied theoretically to solve POMDPs in Baisero's work~\cite{baisero-dqn,baisero-ppo}.
The connections from Deep RL in IBMDPs for objective is absent from \cite{topin2021iterative} and we defer their connections to direct interpretable reinforcement learning to the next chapter as our primary goal is to reproduce \cite{topin2021iterative} \textit{as is}.
Next, we present the precise experimental setup we use to reproduce~\cite{topin2021iterative} in order to study direct deep reinforcement learning of decision tree policies for the CartPole MDP.

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\subsubsection{(IB)MDP} 

We use the exact same downstream MDP and associated IBMDPs for our experiments as~\cite{topin2021iterative} except when mentioned otherwise.

\paragraph{downstream MDP} The task at hand is to optimize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) with a decision tree policy for the CartPole MDP~\cite{cartpole}.
At each time step a learning algorithm observes the cart's position and velocity and the pole's angle and angular velocity, and can take action to push the CartPole left or right.
While the CartPole is roughly balanced, i.e., while the cart's angle remains in some fixed range, the agent gets a positive reward.
If the CartPole is out of balance, the MDP transitions to an absorbing terminal state and gets 0 reward forever.
Like in~\cite{topin2021iterative}, we use the gymnasium \texttt{CartPole-v0} implementation~\cite{gymnasium} of the CartPole MDP in which trajectories are truncated after 200 timesteps making the maximum cumulative reward, i.e. the optimal value of the RL objective when $\gamma=1$, to be 200.
The state features of the CartPole MDP are in $[-2, 2] \times [-2, 2] \times [-0.14, 0.14] \times [-1.4, 1.4]$.

\paragraph{IBMDP} Authors define the associated IBMDP (definition~\ref{def:ibmdp}) with $\zeta=-0.01$ and 4 information gathering actions.
In appendix~\ref{sec:ibmdp-paper}, we give more details about how the authors of the original IBMDP paper chose the information gathering actions.
In addition to the original IBMDP paper, we also try $\zeta=0.01$ and 3 information gathering actions.
We use the same discount factor as the authors: $\gamma=1$.
We try two different approaches to limit the depth of decision tree policies to be at most 2: terminating trajectories if the agent takes too many information gathering actions in a row or simply giving a reward of $-1$ to the agent every time it takes an information gathering action past the depth limit.
In practice, we could have tried an action masking approach, i.e. having a state dependent-action set, but we want to abide to the MDP formalism in order to properly understand direct interpretable approaches.
We will also try IBMDPs where we do not limit the maximum depth for completeness.


\subsubsection{Baselines}
\paragraph{Modified DQN and Modified PPO} as mentioned above, the authors use the modified version of DQN from algorithm~\ref{alg:mod-dqn}.
We use the exact same hyperparameters for modified DQN as the authors when possible. 
We use the same layers width (128) and number of hidden layers (2), the same exploration strategy ($\epsilon$-greedy with linearly decreasing value $\epsilon$ between 0.5 and 0.05 during the first 10\% of the training),
the same replay buffer size ($10^6$) and the same number of transitions to be collected randomly before doing value updates ($10^5$).
We also try to use more exploration during training (change the initial $\epsilon$ value to 0.9).
We use the same optimizer (RMSprop with hyperparameter 0.95 and learning rate $2.5 \times 10^{-4}$) to update the $Q$-networks.
Authors did not share which DQN implementation they used so we use the stable-baselines3 one~\cite{stable-baselines3}.
Authors did not share which activation functions they used so we try both $\operatorname{tanh}$ and $\operatorname{relu}$. 
For the modified PPO algorithm (algorithm~\ref{alg:mod-ppo}), we can exactly match the authors hyperparameters since they use the open source stable-baselines3 implementation of PPO.
We match training budgets: we train modified DQN on 1 million timesteps and modified PPO on 4 million timesteps.

\paragraph{DQN and PPO} We also benchmark the standard DQN and PPO when learning standard Markovian IBMDP policies $\pi:S\times O\rightarrow A\cup A_{info}$ and when learning standard $\pi:S\rightarrow A$ policies directly in the CartPole MDP.
We summarize hyperparameters for the IBMDP and for the learning algorithms in appendices~\ref{tab:ibmdp-params}, \ref{tab:ibmdp-rl1} and \ref{tab:ibmdp-rl2}.

\paragraph{Indirect methods} We also compare modified RL algorithm to imitation learning (section \ref{sec:imit}).
To do so, we use VIPER or Dagger (algorithms~\ref{alg:dagger} and~\ref{alg:viper}) to imitate greedy neural network policies obtained with standard DQN learning directly on CartPole.
We use Dagger to imitate neural network policies obtained with the standard PPO learning directly on CartPole. 
For each indirect method, we imitate the neural network experts by fitting decision trees on 10000 expert transitions using the CART (algorithm~\ref{alg:cart}) implementation from scikit-learn~\cite{scikit-learn} with default hyperparameters and maximum depth of 2 like in ~\cite{topin2021iterative}.
    
\subsubsection{Metrics}
The key metric of this section is performance when controlling the CartPole, i.e, the average \textit{undiscounted} cumulative reward of a policy on 100 trajectories (RL objective with $\gamma=1$).
For modified RL algorithms that learn a memoryless policy (or $Q$-function) in an IBMDP, we periodically extract the policy (or $Q$-function) and use algorithm~\ref{alg:extract-tree} to extract a decision tree for the CartPole MDP. 
We then evaluate the tree on 100 independent trajectories in the MDP and report the mean undiscounted cumulative reward.
For RL applied to IBMDPs, since we can't deploy learned policies directly to the downstream MDP as the state dimensions mismatch--such policies are $S\times O\rightarrow A \cup A_{info}$ but the MDP states are in $S$--we periodically evaluate those IBMDP policies in a copy of the IBMDP in which we fix $\zeta=0$ ensuring that the copied IBMDP undiscounted cumulative rewards only account rewards from the CartPole MDP (non-zero rewards in the IBMDP only occur when a reward from the downstream MDP is given, i.e. when $a_t\in A$ in the IBMDP (definition~\ref{def:ibmdp})).
Similarly, we do 100 trajectories of the extracted policies in the copied IBMDP and report the average undiscounted cumulative reward.
For RL applied directly to the downstream MDP we can just periodically extract the learned policies and evaluate them on 100 CartPole trajectories.

Since imitation learning baselines train offline, i.e, on a fixed dataset, their performances cannot directly be reported on the same axis as RL baselines.
For that reason, during the training of a standard RL baseline, we periodically extract the trained neural policy/$Q$-function that we consider as the expert to imitate.
Those experts are then imitated with VIPER or Dagger using 10 000 newly generated transitions and then fitsted decision tree policies are then evaluated on 100 CartPole trajectories.
We do not report the imitation learning objective values during VIPER or Dagger training.
Every single combination of IBMDP and Modified RL hyperparameters is run 20 times.
For standard RL on either an IBMDP or an MDP, we use the paper original hyperparameters when they were specified, with depth control using negative rewards, $\operatorname{tanh()}$ activations.
We use 20 individual random seeds for every experiment in this chapter.
Next, we present our results when reproducing~\cite{topin2021iterative}.

(a) Shows variations of modified DQN and DQN (table~\ref{tab:ibmdp-rl1}), while (b) shows variations of modified PPO and PPO (table~\ref{tab:ibmdp-rl2}). For both algorithms, we give different line-styles for the learning curves when applied directly on the CartPole MDP versus when applied on the IBMDP to learn standard Markovian policies. We color the modified RL algorithm variant from the original paper in black. Shaded areas represent the confidence interval at 95\% at each measure on the y-axis.}
\end{figure*}
On figure~\ref{fig:res-dqn}, we observe that modified DQN can learn in IBMDPs--the curves have an increasing trend--but we also observe that modified DQN finds poor decision tree policies for the CartPole MDP in average--the curves flatten at the end of the x-axis and have low y-values.
In particular, the highest final y-value, among all the learning curves that could possibly correspond to the original paper modified DQN, correspond to poor performances on the CartPole MDP.
On figure~\ref{fig:res-ppo}, we observe that modified PPO finds decision tree policies with almost 150 cumulative rewards towards the end of training.
The performance difference with modified DQN could be because we trained modified PPO longer, like in the original paper.
However it could also be because DQN-like algorithms with those hyperparameters struggle to learn in CartPole (IB)MDPs.
Indeed, we notice that for DQN-like baselines, learning seems difficult in general independently of the setting.
On figures~\ref{fig:res-dqn} and~\ref{fig:res-ppo}, we observe that standard RL baselines (RL + IBMDP and RL + MDP), learn better CartPole policies in average than their modified counterparts that learn memoryless policies (proposition~\ref{def:po-policy}). 
On figure~\ref{fig:res-ppo}, it is clear that for the standard PPO baselines, learning is super efficient and algorithms learn optimal policies with reward 200 in few thousands steps.

\end{figure}


On figure~\ref{fig:ppo-trees}, we isolate the best performing algorithms instantiations that learn decision tree policies for the CartPole MDP.
We compare the best modified DQN and modified PPO to imitation learning baselines that use the surrogate imitation objective (definition~\ref{def:il}) to find CartPole decision tree policies.
We find that despite having poor performances in \textit{average}, the modified deep reinforcement learning baselines can find very good decision tree policies as shown by the min-max shaded areas on the left of figure~\ref{fig:ppo-trees} and the corresponding estimated density of learned trees performances.
However this is not desirable, a user typically wants an algorithm that can consistently find good decision tree policies.
As shown by the estimated densities, indirect methods consistently find good decision tree policies (the higher modes of distributions are on the right of the plot).
On the other hand, the decision tree policies returned by direct RL methods seem equally distributed on both extremes of the scores.

On figure~\ref{fig:trees-drl}, we present the best decision tree policies for CartPole returned by modified DQN and modified PPO.
We used algorithm~\ref{alg:extract-tree} to extract 20 trees from the 20 memoryless policies returned by the modified deep reinforcement learning algorithms over the 20 training seeds.
We then plot the best tree for each baseline.
Those trees get an average RL objective of roughly 175.
Similarly, we plot a representative tree for imitation learning baseline as well as a tree that is optimal for CartPole w.r.t. the RL objective obtained with VIPER. 
Unlike for direct methods, the trees returned by imitation learning are extremely similar across seeds. In particular they often only vary in the scalar value used in the root node but in general have the same structure and test the angular velocity.
On the other hand the most frequent trees across seeds returned by modified RL baselines are ``trivial'' decision tree policies that either repeat the same downstream action forever or repeat the same IGA (definition~\ref{def:ibmdp}) forever.

We have shown that compared to learning non-interpretable but standard Markovian neural network policies for the downstream MDP or some associated IBMDP, reinforcement learning of memoryless policies in IBMDP is less efficient (figures~\ref{fig:res-dqn} and~\ref{fig:res-ppo}). 
As a consequence, only a handful of modified RL runs are able to learn decision tree policies that are on par with imitated trees (figure~\ref{fig:ppo-trees}).
In the next chapter, we highlight the connections between direct interpretable RL (definition~\ref{def:irl}) and POMDPs to get insights on the hardness of direct reinforcement learning of decision trees.

From the previous chapter, we know that to directly learn decision tree policies that optimize the RL objective (definition~\ref{def:mdp-obj}) for an MDP (definition~\ref{def:mdp}), one can learn a deterministic memoryless policy that optimizes the interpretable RL objective (definition~\ref{def:irl}) in an IBMDP (definition~\ref{def:ibmdp} and proposition~\ref{def:po-policy}).
Such problems are classical instances of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs)~\cite{POMDP,chap2}.
This connection with POMDPs brings novel insights to direct reinforcement learning of decision tree policies. 
In this chapter, all the decision processes have a finite number of vector-valued states and observations.
Hence we will use bold fonts for states and observations but we can still use summations rather than integrals when required.

\section{RL objective values}\label{calcs}
\paragraph{Optimal depth-1 decision tree policy} $\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}$ has one root node that tests $x\leq1$ (respectively $y\leq1$) and two leaf nodes $\rightarrow$ and $\downarrow$. 
    To compute $V^\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}(\boldsymbol{o}_0)$, we compute the values of $\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}$ in each of the possible starting states $(\boldsymbol{s}_0, \boldsymbol{o}_0), (\boldsymbol{s}_1, \boldsymbol{o}_0), (\boldsymbol{s}_2, \boldsymbol{o}_0), (\boldsymbol{s}_g, \boldsymbol{o}_0)$ and compute the expectation over those. 
    At initialization, when the downstream state is $\boldsymbol{s}_g = (1.5, 0.5)$, the depth-1 decision tree policy cycles between taking an information gathering action $x\leq1$ and moving down to get a positive reward for which it gets the returns:
    \begin{align*}
        V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_g, \boldsymbol{o}_0) &= \zeta + \gamma + \gamma^2 \zeta + \gamma^3 \dots \\
        &= \overset{\infty}{\underset{t=0}\sum} \gamma^{2t} \zeta + \overset{\infty}{\underset{t=0}\sum} \gamma^{2t+1} \\
        &= \frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1 - \gamma^2}
    \end{align*}
    At initialization, in either of the downstream states $\boldsymbol{s}_0=(0.5,0.5)$ and $\boldsymbol{s}_2=(1.5, 1.5)$, the value of the depth-1 decision tree policy is the return when taking one information gathering action $x\leq1$, then moving right or down, then following the policy from the goal state $\boldsymbol{s}_g$:
    \begin{align*}
        V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_0, o_0) &= \zeta + \gamma 0 + \gamma^2 V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_g, o_0) \\
        &= \zeta + \gamma^2 V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_g, o_0) \\
        &= V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_2, o_0)
    \end{align*}
    Similarly, the value of the best depth-1 decision tree policy in state $\boldsymbol{s}_1=(0.5,1.5)$ is the value of taking one information gathering action then moving right to $\boldsymbol{s}_2$ then following the policy in $\boldsymbol{s}_2$:
    \begin{align*}
        V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_1, \boldsymbol{o}_0) &= \zeta + \gamma 0 + \gamma^2 V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_2, \boldsymbol{o}_0) \\
        &= \zeta + \gamma^2 V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_2, o_0) \\
        &= \zeta + \gamma^2 (\zeta + \gamma^2 V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_g, o_0)) \\
        &= \zeta + \gamma^2 \zeta + \gamma^4 V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_g, o_0)
    \end{align*}
    Since the probability of being in any downstream states at initialization given that the observation is $\boldsymbol{o}_0$ is simply the probability of being in any downstream states at initialization, we can write:
    \begin{align*}
        V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{o}_0) &= \frac{1}{4} V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_g, \boldsymbol{o}_0) + \frac{2}{4} V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_2, \boldsymbol{o}_0) + \frac{1}{4} V^{\pi_{\mathcal{T}_1}} (\boldsymbol{s}_1, \boldsymbol{o}_0) \\
        &= \frac{1}{4} \frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1 - \gamma^2} + \frac{2}{4} (\zeta + \gamma^2 \frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1 - \gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4} (\zeta + \gamma^2 \zeta + \gamma^4 \frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1 - \gamma^2}) \\
        &= \frac{1}{4} \frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1 - \gamma^2} + \frac{2}{4} (\frac{\zeta + \gamma ^ 3}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4}(\frac{\zeta+\gamma^5}{1-\gamma^2}) \\
        &= \frac{4\zeta + \gamma + 2\gamma^3 + \gamma^5}{4(1-\gamma^2)}
    \end{align*}

\paragraph{Depth-0 decision tree:} has only one leaf node that takes a single downstream action indefinitely.
For this type of tree the best reward achievable is to take actions that maximize the probability of reaching the objective $\rightarrow$ or $\downarrow$. In that case the objective value of such tree is:
In the goal state $G = (1, 0)$, the value of the depth-0 tree $\mathcal{T}_0$ is:
\begin{align*}
    V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_G &= 1 + \gamma + \gamma^2 + \dots \\
    &= \overset{\infty}{\underset{t=0}\sum} \gamma^t \\
    &= \frac{1}{1 - \gamma}
\end{align*}
In the state $(0, 0)$ when the policy repeats going right respectively in the state $(0, 1)$ when the policy repeats going down, the value is:
\begin{align*}
    V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_{S_0} &= 0 + \gamma V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_g \\
    &= \gamma V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_G
\end{align*}
In the other states the policy never gets positive rewards; $V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_{S_1} = V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_{S_2} = 0$. Hence:
\begin{align*}
J(\mathcal{T}_0) &= \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_G + \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_{S_0}+ \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_{S_1}+ \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_{S_2} \\
&= \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_G + \frac{1}{4} \gamma V^{\mathcal{T}_0}_G + 0 + 0\\
&= \frac{1}{4} \frac{1}{1 - \gamma} + \frac{1}{4} \gamma \frac{1}{1 - \gamma} \\
&= \frac{1 + \gamma}{4(1 - \gamma)}
\end{align*}

\paragraph{Unbalanced depth-2 decision tree:}the unbalanced depth-2 decision tree  takes an information gathering action $x\leq0.5$ then either takes the $\downarrow$ action or takes a second information $y\leq0.5$ followed by $\rightarrow$ or $\downarrow$.
In states $G$ and $S_2$, the value of the unbalanced tree is the same as for the depth-1 tree.
In states $S_0$ and $S_1$, the policy takes two information gathering actions before taking a downstream action and so on:
\begin{align*}
    V^{\mathcal{T}_{u}}_{S_0} &= \zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 2 0 + \gamma ^ 3 V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G
\end{align*} 
\begin{align*}
    V^{\mathcal{T}_{u}}_{S_1} &= \zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 2 0 + \gamma ^ 3 V^{\mathcal{T}_u}_{S_0} \\ 
    &= \zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 2 0 + \gamma ^ 3 (\zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 2 0 + \gamma ^ 3 V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G) \\
    &= \zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 3 \zeta + \gamma ^ 4 \zeta + \gamma ^ 6 V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G
\end{align*}
We get:
\begin{align*}
    J(\mathcal{T}_{u}) &= \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_u}_G + \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_u}_{S_0} + \frac{1}{4}V^{\mathcal{T}_u}_{S_1} + \frac{1}{4}V^{\mathcal{T}_u}_{S_2} \\
    &=  \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G + \frac{1}{4}(\zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 3 V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G) + \frac{1}{4} (\zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 3 \zeta + \gamma ^ 4 \zeta + \gamma ^ 6 V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G) + \frac{1}{4}V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_{S_2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} (\frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4}(\frac{\gamma\zeta + \gamma^4 + \zeta -\gamma^2\zeta}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4} (\zeta + \gamma \zeta + \gamma ^ 3 \zeta + \gamma ^ 4 \zeta + \gamma ^ 6 V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_G) + \frac{1}{4}V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_{S_2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} (\frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4}(\frac{\gamma\zeta + \gamma^4 + \zeta -\gamma^2\zeta}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4} (\frac{\zeta + \gamma\zeta -\gamma^2\zeta-\gamma^5\zeta+\gamma^6\zeta+\gamma^7}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4}V^{\mathcal{T}_1}_{S_2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} (\frac{\zeta + \gamma}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4}(\frac{\gamma\zeta + \gamma^4 + \zeta -\gamma^2\zeta}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4} (\frac{\zeta + \gamma\zeta -\gamma^2\zeta-\gamma^5\zeta+\gamma^6\zeta+\gamma^7}{1-\gamma^2}) + \frac{1}{4}(\frac{\zeta + \gamma ^ 3}{1-\gamma^2}) \\
    &= \frac{\zeta(4+2\gamma-2\gamma^2-\gamma^5+\gamma^6)+\gamma+\gamma^3+\gamma^4+\gamma^7}{4(1-\gamma^2)}
\end{align*}
\paragraph{The balanced depth-2 decision tree:}alternates in every state between taking the two available information gathering actions and then a downstream action.
The value of the policy in the goal state is:
\begin{align*}
    V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_{G} &= \zeta + \gamma\zeta + \gamma^2 + \gamma^3\zeta + \gamma^4\zeta + \dots \\
    &= \overset{\infty}{\underset{t=0}\sum} \gamma^{3t}\zeta + \overset{\infty}{\underset{t=0}\sum} \gamma^{3t+1}\zeta + \overset{\infty}{\underset{t=0}\sum} \gamma^{3t+2} \\
    &= \frac{\zeta}{1-\gamma^3} + \frac{\gamma\zeta}{1-\gamma^3} + \frac{\gamma^2}{1-\gamma^3}
\end{align*}
Following the same reasoning for other states we find the objective value for the depth-2 decision tree policy to be:
\begin{align*}
    J(\mathcal{T}_2) &=\frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_G + \frac{2}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_{S_2} + \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_{S_1} \\
    &= \frac{1}{4} V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_G + \frac{2}{4}(\zeta + \gamma\zeta + \gamma^2 0 + \gamma^3V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_G) + \frac{1}{4} (\zeta+\gamma\zeta+\gamma^2 0 + \gamma^3\zeta+\gamma^4\zeta+\gamma^5 0 +\gamma^6 V^{\mathcal{T}_2}_G) \\
    &= \frac{\zeta(3+3\gamma)+\gamma^2+\gamma^5+\gamma^8}{4(1-\gamma^3)}
\end{align*}
\paragraph{Infinite tree:} we also consider the infinite tree policy that repeats an information gathering action forever and has objective: $J(\mathcal{T_{\text{inf}}}) = \frac{\zeta}{1-\gamma}$

\paragraph{Stochastic policy:} the other non-trivial policy that can be learned by solving a partially observable IBMDP is the stochastic policy that guarantees to reach $G$ after some time: fifty percent chance to do $\rightarrow$ and fifty percent chance to do $\downarrow$.
This stochastic policy has objective value:
\begin{align*}
    V^{\text{stoch}}_G &= \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \\
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_0} &= 0 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} \\
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_2} &= 0 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} = V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_0} \\
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} &= 0 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_2} + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G = \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_0} + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G
\end{align*}
Solving these equations:
\begin{align*}
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} &= \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_0} + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\gamma (\frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1}) + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 V^{\text{stoch}}_G + \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G \\
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} &= \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 V^{\text{stoch}}_G + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G \\
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1}(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2) &= (\frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma) V^{\text{stoch}}_G \\
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} &= \frac{\frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma}{1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2} V^{\text{stoch}}_G \\
    &= \frac{\gamma(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2} \cdot \frac{1}{1-\gamma} \\
    &= \frac{\gamma(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_0} &= \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_G + \frac{1}{2}\gamma V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}\gamma \cdot \frac{1}{1-\gamma} + \frac{1}{2}\gamma \cdot \frac{\gamma(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}\gamma}{1-\gamma} + \frac{\frac{1}{2}\gamma^2(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}\gamma(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2) + \frac{1}{2}\gamma^2(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}\gamma - \frac{1}{8}\gamma^3 + \frac{1}{8}\gamma^3 + \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{2}\gamma + \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)} \\
    &= \frac{\gamma(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}\gamma)}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}
\end{align*}
\begin{align*}
    J(\mathcal{T}_{\text{stoch}}) &= \frac{1}{4}(V^{\text{stoch}}_G + V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_0} + V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_1} + V^{\text{stoch}}_{S_2}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} + 2 \cdot \frac{\gamma(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}\gamma)}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)} + \frac{\gamma(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} + \frac{2\gamma(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}\gamma) + \gamma(\frac{1}{4}\gamma + \frac{1}{2})}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} + \frac{\gamma + \frac{1}{2}\gamma^2 + \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 + \frac{1}{2}\gamma}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1}{1-\gamma} + \frac{\frac{3}{2}\gamma + \frac{3}{4}\gamma^2}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2 + \frac{3}{2}\gamma + \frac{3}{4}\gamma^2}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1 + \frac{3}{2}\gamma + \frac{1}{2}\gamma^2}{(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}\right) \\
    &= \frac{1 + \frac{3}{2}\gamma + \frac{1}{2}\gamma^2}{4(1 - \frac{1}{4}\gamma^2)(1-\gamma)}
