\begin{abstract}
  For applications like medicine, machine learning models ought to be interpretable. In that case, models like decision trees are preferred over neural networks because humans can read their predictions from the root to the leaves.
  Learning such decision trees for sequential decision making problems is a relatively new research direction and most of the existing literature focuses on imitating (or distilling) neural networks.
  In contrast, we study reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that \textit{directly} return decision trees optimizing some trade-off of cumulative rewards and interpretability in a Markov decision process (MDP). 
  We show that such algorithms can be seen as learning policies for partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).
  We use this parallel to understand why in practice it is often easier to use imitation learning than to learn the decision tree from scratch for MDPs.

\section{Discussion}
In this paper, we studied algorithms that learn decision tree policies in MDPs while directly optimizing the interpretability–performance trade-off, without relying on an oracle or expert. Building on the IBMDP formulation of~\citet{topin2021iterative}, we showed that this problem can be reframed as learning deterministic memoryless policies in a POMDP setting, which we call POIBMDPs. By connecting to the POMDP literature, we conjectured that partial observability is the main obstacle to reinforcement learning of decision tree policies. Experiments on carefully designed benchmarks with known optimal trees supported this view: good decision tree policies were learned only when partial observability was absent.

Given these challenges, pursuing methods to overcome partial observability in POIBMDPs may not be the most promising direction. Although specialized algorithms might exist, imitation learning remains effective in practice and has long been state-of-the-art for interpretable sequential decision making. Moreover, the framework of~\citet{topin2021iterative} still leaves open issues, such as choosing the information-gathering actions and choosing $\zeta$ to target a desired trade-off.

Finally, while we focused on non-parametric tree learning, an alternative direction is improving reinforcement learning for parametric tree policies. These can be optimized directly in the downstream MDP, but existing methods~\cite{silva,vos2024optimizinginterpretabledecisiontree,sympol} require retraining from scratch for each tree structure. Future work should therefore develop approaches that reuse samples across structures, reducing the need for strong prior knowledge about the policy form.
\section*{Impact statement}
Our work put great emphasis on covering existing work, open sourcing code, and being transparent about limitations.
We hope that the impact of our work is going to be positive for society through advancing reseach in interpretable machine learning.
